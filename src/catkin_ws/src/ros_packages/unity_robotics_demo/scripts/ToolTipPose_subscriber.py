# NODE EXPLAINATION
# this node takes a message from unity and sends a message to ros, on the unity side the user decides the orientation of the ToolTipPose, this orientation is sent
# to ros trough the PosRotCommand; this message is taken from this node and sent to gazebo as a new message: one_task_inverse_kinematics/command,
# afterwards gazebo moves the model in order to obtain the appropriate robot configuration (nb at this point the joints_publisher script sends the new
# joints values to unity so the user sees the robot takin the orientation he wanted)

#this function is called when the ros script receives the message from unity with the pose and oroentation of the tool tip
